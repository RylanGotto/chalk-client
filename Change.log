- create board works a board has to exists before a post can be created. When an account is created it also creates a board titled
<usernames's board> obviously we can change this to something more robust!

- create post works rudimentarily, it simply gets request from client and saves to an already created board. The features in add forums do work.
	- The two features in the add post forum are simply to establish some sort of user use case.

- Created a new service which gets all those posts currently on myBoard and displays it on refresh, we will have to look into how to use services more.

- added a potential layout for posts, it is the stock layout from ionic
